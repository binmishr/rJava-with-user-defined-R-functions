# rJava-with-user-defined-R-functions

Weâ€™ve learned how to insert R commands to Eclipse Java in the previous post. But as the number of lines of R commands is too many, overall code readability and maintenance could be deteriorated. In this case, it is preferred to use R script which contains user-defined or built-in R functions. This means that essencially one line of code will do rather than multiple lines of commands.

Suppose that we performs Lasso regression in Java using R script. The rest of the codeset is attached in the .docx file in this repository.
